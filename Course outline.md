1. What is computation?
Introduce what is an algorithm, computer architecture and fundamental concepts in programming
clear definitions for technical terms such as Commands “executed”, definitions “evaluated ”
python objects, expressions, operators, binding variables

2. Branching and Iteration
Introduce string operations, input
Comparison & Logical operators
Control Flow Branching ( if, elif, else)
Iteration ( while and for loops)
3. String Manipulation, Guess and Check, Approximations, Bisection
Elaboration on string operations and iteration through string
using guess the cube root example to illustrate guess & check algorithm, approximation algorithm and bisection search algorithms

4. Decomposition, Abstractions, Functions
defining functions
distinguishing between variable scope and global scope ( the walk through are very comprehensive and clear)
nested functions

5. Tuples, Lists, Aliasing, Mutability, Cloning
Introduce & compare Tuples and List
Iteration through list and tuples
List methods & operations
Mutability & side effect of mutating list
Cloning a list to avoid side effect
Nested list

6. Recursion, Dictionaries ( clearly explains one of the most confusing topic for beginners! Pay Attention!)
Recursion with classic examples: Fibonacci sequence, multiplication, factorial, the tower of Hanoi
Memoization of Fibonacci recursion using dictionary
Compare list and dictionary
Dictionary operations

7. Testing, Debugging, Exceptions, Assertions
Explore different classes of test and testing approaches
Introduce you to some debugging tools
Familiarize you with error messages
Specifying handlers for exceptions ( customize what to return when hits an unexpected condition)
Raising expectations
specifying assertions

8. Object Oriented Programming
Creating a class
defining methods, attributes of a class, how to create an instance for a class
how to ‘use’ a class created

9. Python Classes and Inheritance
Follow on lesson from lecture 8
difference between a class and an instance for that class
class variable and instance variable
creating child class from parent class

10–11.Understanding Program Efficiency
Operation efficiency and asymptotic growth
Explore how to indicate common characteristics of algorithms that we could use to infer their complexity
briefly introduce list access time

12. Searching and Sorting
merge sort algorithm
also explores other type of sort and search algorithms
